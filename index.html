            <h2>3. Methods</h2>
            <p>Present proposed solutions including specific data processing methods and machine learning algorithms, and elaborate on why you think each will be effective. It is recommended to identify specific functions/classes in existing packages and libraries (i.e., scikit-learn) rather than coding the algorithms from scratch.</p>
